# Analyzing_Global_Climate_Change_Data_for_Policy_Insights
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global climate-change dataset sourced from Kaggle. Acting as a data consultant for an international environmental agency, the objective of this work is to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships that can support evidence-based climate policies.

The project includes:

- Thorough data understanding and preparation, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

- A structured EDA workflow, covering univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis across climate indicators such as temperature, CO₂ emissions, rainfall, sea-level rise, population, and renewable-energy      usage.

- A set of targeted analytical questions designed to explore climate trends across countries and years.

- Key insights translated into real-world policy recommendations, highlighting opportunities in areas like renewable-energy adoption, emissions control, and ecosystem protection.

- Interactive visualizations/dashboard for clear communication of findings to policymakers.

This repository demonstrates how analytical thinking, data exploration, and visualization can guide impactful decisions in global climate resilience.
